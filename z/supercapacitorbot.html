        <p>I have recently become interested in supercapacitors. Unlike batteries that require specific current, voltage, and time to charge without starting a fire, supercapacitors just need control of the voltage and they charging automatically when they are full. No additional circuits are required, and much less maintenance. They are also able to go through MUCH more discharge cycles with less degradation.</p>
        <p>The most useful real world application currently is the chinese supercapacitor bus. The biggest disadvange supercaps have to batteries is their energy density. So unless you don't mind putting a huge </p>
