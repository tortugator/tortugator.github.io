        <h1>metamorphosis</h1>
        <img src="/image/metamorphosis/frog.JPG" alt="frog">
        <p>One of the <a href="/z/tadpoles.html">tadpoles</a> has metamorphosized into a tiny froglet. It was found in the water with legs stretched out and not moving. I picked it up with a spoon, and it did not really react. I thought it had drowned, but after putting it on land for a while it started to move. It was even able to do a powerful jump back to the water and had to be saved again.</p>
        <p>However, this is not the tadpole from last week that had developed legs. Unfortunately he died and I let the rest eat his corpse.</p>

        <p>The picture above and below were on the first day, when there is still a tail. By the next day, it was almost completely absorbed.</p>
        <img src="/image/metamorphosis/froglet.jpg" alt="froglet">
        <p>The tiny beige tadpoles all grew and now they look like smaller versions of the other tadpoles. I also realized I had some tadpoles in there that were another species. The eyes are closer together and the body is not transparent. I have a feeling these will grow to be bigger frogs than the transparent ones.</p>
        <img src="/image/metamorphosis/tadpoles.jpg" alt="tadpoles">
        <p>To feed the newly metamorphosized froglet, springtails have been collected from the isopod tub. I have not seen him catch a springtail, but he has a reaction to them. It is probably still too early in the metamorphosis and he is still getting nutrition from the absorbed tail.</p>
        <p>There is another tadpole that is starting to grow legs. It will probably be a froglet by next weekend. A seperate dryer environment will be made to house the future froglets.</p>
